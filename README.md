This is still a work in progres

The whole thing is split into 2 parts, the editor and the actual game 

Editor:

-Left click and hold to draw lines for the walls

-Right click will create a rectangle that will destroy anything thats COMPLETELY in it

-Middle mouse button will TP the player to your location

-(1-3) change textures, names are displayed in the bottom left hand corner, colours are also different for different walls on the editor

-S key will save whatever you have drawn into the text file (planning on adding the possibilty to have more than one map)

-Enter will switch to game

Game:

-WASD for movement

-L and R arrows to look

-Enter to switchg to editor
